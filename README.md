# Sentiment analysis on Cracco Milano restaurant reviews

## Project Introduction

The digital presence of restaurants gives them chance to reach more and more customers. They advertise their businesses using social media as we live in a digital era filled with daily technical innovations. Nowadays restaurants want to figure out people’s opinions about their food and service. Performing sentiment analysis, I aim to analyze the data from the customer's reviews and evaluate such information with good accuracy.


[**Cracco**](https://www.ristorantecracco.it/en/) is the eponymous new restaurant of Italy’s Michelin-starred chef Carlo Cracco. The exquisite design of this four-floor culinary paradise is just as compelling as the incredibly innovative food. And it has already become a must-see gastronomic milestone. The actual restaurant is arranged in three rooms and two private spaces. The cuisine will continue in the same vein as in the restaurant on Via Victor Hugo. There will be plenty of classic dishes, including caramelized Russian salad, marinated egg yolk, saffron risotto with bone marrow, turbot in a cocoa crust and more. They try to always do everything in the name of a harmonious combination of tradition and innovation.

Many people use Yelp to find a good restaurant. For this project, I decided to use information from the Cracco restaurant page on Yelp. Using web scraping, we can get all the reviews posted there and make an analysis. The analysis of users’ opinions and the extraction of their food preferences lead to the provision of personalized recommendations, which is a research gap in literature.
